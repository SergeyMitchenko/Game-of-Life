# Game of Live

This is my Implementation of Conway's Game of Life
No setup is needed. Just open the index.html (Tested in Chrome)
Instructions are given on the bottom of the site

Some TODOs I wasn't able to implement:
- Even further optimize the algorithm (Hashlife)
- Try to implement a 3D version of the Game of Life
- Store more interesting presets
- Implement a pretty site with CSS

The source code is in the game_of_live.js file.
The code execuded in the html is in the game_of_live_bundle.js file which is a browserify version of the game_of_live.js code with the required libraries.
Libraries I used: p5.js, dat-gui.js
